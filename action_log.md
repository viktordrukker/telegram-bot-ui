# Action Log for Telegram Bot UI

## Initial Setup
- Cloned repository `viktordrukker/telegram-bot-ui` to `/workspace/telegram-bot-ui`.
- Installed dependencies (`flask==3.1.0`) as per `requirements.txt`.
- Updated `telegram_bot_ui.py` to use port `56497` (available port).
- Started Flask application on port `56497`.

## Issues Encountered
- Port `53986` was already in use, so switched to `56497`.
- Port `56497` is also in use, preventing the application from starting.
- Application process stopped unexpectedly, requiring a restart.

## Next Steps
- Updated the `Dockerfile` to fix port inconsistencies and add a health check.
- Build the Docker image using:
  ```bash
  docker build -t telegram-bot-ui .
  ```
- Run the Docker container using:
  ```bash
  docker run -p 53986:53986 telegram-bot-ui
  ```
- Verify the application by visiting `http://localhost:53986`.
- Implement additional features or fixes as required.
